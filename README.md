# school_covid19

This repository refers to the number of hospital admissions and deaths among teachers and workers during the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic.

In addition, we compared hospital admissions and deaths of teaching workers with the general population, taking into account age and period of years.

At the very least, we analyzed whether socio-territorial inequalities could influence the number of hospital admissions and deaths caused by Sars-Cov-2.

The file with the deaths and hospital admissions over 25MB. Thus, it is necessary to download it here: << https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sB0dE62DEc5Ko3ZcYPM4NnQTETzbKIxL/view?usp=sharing >>

The result of these analitic endeavours was published -as a paper- in: << https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/pt/biblio-1357429 >>
