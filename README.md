This repository refers to the number of hospital admissions and deaths among teachers and workers during the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic.
In addition, we compared hospital admissions and deaths of teaching workers with the general population, taking into account age and period of years.
At the very least, we analyzed whether socio-territorial inequalities could influence the number of hospital admissions and deaths caused by Sars-Cov-2.
